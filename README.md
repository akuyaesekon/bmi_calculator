This is a BMI calculator that outputs the weight in kgs and tells the user
if he is underweight, overweight or suffers from obesity.

Was built during hackathon coding session at Moi University.

##What I learned.
Mathematical Algorithms that calcultes and Reculculates Weights
and finaly returns the bmi results.

##Testing
Speed and Skill-set
